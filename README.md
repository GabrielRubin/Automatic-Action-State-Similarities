# Planning class final project: Automatic Action-State Similarities

Made with IntelliJ and Pycharm IDEs, and there are .idea files for both.
Java folder contains the domain in Java and the Python folder contains the autoencoder source (with some graph-making scripts too).
I don't code in Java very often, and never profissionally, so I'm not familiar with Maven, and thus, there are probably missing packages that are needed in order to run the code.
If there is anything I can do to help in running this code, let me know.
